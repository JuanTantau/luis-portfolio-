      <p>
        Hi my name is Juan Luis Tantau but everybody calls me "Luis". I am 23 years old, Born in Cuba. I came to Miami
        when I was just 2 Years old and have lived here ever since.
        I graduated high school in 2017 and immediately started working with animals. I spent 5 Years working and
        learning to become a Veterinary Technician
        but recently decided to completely change my line of work. Now I am here studying Computer sciences/coding.
